# _Balls Experiment_

This is a try out project for compiling something and running it in OpenCV using Java. 
It's based on Hough Transform samples, and I've run it on images containing rubber balls to see if the Hough transform is effective in detecting them.

## Project Setup

This project was compiled with OpenCV version 2.4.8 on Ubuntu 14.04. It was compiled using OpenJDK 2.4.7
